# Get-And-Clean-Data

Aouncement: the raw data are from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

In this repository, there are 3 documents: README.md, the codebook and the main script run_analysis.R.

The basic objective of this project is to clean the raw data and organize it for later analysis.

The steps are listed below:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
